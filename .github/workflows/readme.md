# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline for Spring PetClinic with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates how to implement a **CI/CD pipeline** for a Java Spring Boot application (Spring PetClinic) using **GitHub Actions**, **SonarCloud**, and **Docker Hub**.  

The pipeline automates the process of building, analyzing, containerizing, and publishing the application with every change pushed to the repository.  

---

## 🔄 Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in:  
📂 `.github/workflows/maven.yml`

The pipeline triggers on:
- Pushes to the **`main`** branch  
- Pull requests  

It contains a single job called **`build-analyze-deploy`** which executes the following steps:

1. **Checkout Code**  
   Pulls the source code from the GitHub repository.

2. **Set up Java**  
   Installs **JDK 17 (Temurin)** to provide the required Java environment.

3. **Cache Maven Packages**  
   Speeds up build times by caching project dependencies.

4. **Build Project**  
   Compiles and packages the application using Maven.

5. **Run SonarCloud Analysis**  
   Analyzes code quality, security, and maintainability using SonarCloud.

6. **Log in to Docker Hub**  
   Authenticates with Docker Hub using GitHub repository secrets.

7. **Build Docker Image**  
   Builds a Docker image of the application.

8. **Push Docker Image**  
   Publishes the Docker image to the configured Docker Hub repository.

## 🔐 Repository Secrets

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate CI/CD. To securely connect with external services, the following **repository secrets** are configured:

| Name              | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Docker Hub access token with read & write permissions |
| `SONAR_TOKEN`     | SonarCloud token used to authenticate and analyze the project |
| `SONAR_HOST_URL`  | URL of the SonarCloud server (`https://sonarcloud.io`) |

> **Note:** Secrets are stored in GitHub repository settings under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and are **not visible in the repository or logs**.
